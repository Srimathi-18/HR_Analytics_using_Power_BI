**HR Analytics using Power BI**
A comprehensive HR analytics dashboard built in Microsoft Power BI to derive actionable insights from attendance and employee data.


**Project Overview**
This project aims to transform raw attendance and HR data into meaningful visualisations, trends and insights — allowing HR teams and management to identify patterns such as absenteeism, leave trends, department performance, and workforce distribution. The goal is to empower data-driven decision making across talent management, scheduling and workforce planning.
